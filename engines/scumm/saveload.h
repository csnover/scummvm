 * The current savegame format version.
 * Our save/load system uses an elaborate scheme to allow us to modify the
 * savegame while keeping full backward compatibility, in the sense that newer
 * ScummVM versions always are able to load old savegames.
 * In order to achieve that, we store a version in the savegame files, and whenever
 * the savegame layout is modified, the version is incremented.
 *
 * This roughly works by marking each savegame entry with a range of versions
 * for which it is valid; the save/load code iterates over all entries, but
 * only saves/loads those which are valid for the version of the savegame
 * which is being loaded/saved currently.
